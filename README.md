This is a simple hangman game made in c++. Felt like a simple enough idea for a project (maybe too simple) but it provided enough challenge. 
I tried to use things we learned throughout the semester.
No special instructions, just run the .cpp file and play. There is one version with graphics and one without mostly to learn how to use github forks.
